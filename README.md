# NandToTetris
The Nand to Tetris course provided me with a comprehensive, hands-on understanding of how computers work from the ground up. Through this course, I built a computer from basic logic gates (like NAND) all the way to a functioning system capable of running software, including a simple operating system and a compiler.
This experience deepened my understanding of computer architecture, low-level programming, and abstraction layers. It also enhanced my problem-solving skills, as I had to apply theoretical concepts practically to design hardware, implement a virtual machine, and write a high-level language compiler.
Overall, the course gave me a solid foundation in computer science principles and helped me appreciate the inner workings of modern computing systems.
